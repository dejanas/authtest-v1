 # AuthTest
 
 Every instance of AuthTest application has different second step of verification proccess.
 Purpose of this application is to demonstrate various verification methods and to investigate user experiance.
 At the end of each verification process the user is asked to do the simple survey and to add suggestions or comments.

 This project was done as a (practical) part of Bachelor thesis in course Data Security at the University of
 Electrical Engineering in Belgrade under the mentorship of professor Zarko Stanisavljevic, who gave suggestions and revisions
 of theoretical part of the thesis.
